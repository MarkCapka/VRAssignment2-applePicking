README

Currently, we have most of the project done. 

Need to make tweaks to fit the requirements in the project.

Repository is messy currently as there are technically two different projects 
Evan's in hapt.zip 
mine outside of that, layering on the files is currently weird though. 

TODO: 
color bowl
color terrain
ensure positions are correct
confirm prefabs set for different types of apples.
